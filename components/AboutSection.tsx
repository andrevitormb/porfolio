            Hi, my name is Andre and I am a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">{"highly ambitious"}</span>,
            <span className="font-bold">{" self-motivated"}</span>, and
            <span className="font-bold">{" driven"}</span> software engineer
            based in Lisbon, Portugal.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
          I graduated in Network Engineering from Mackenzie Brazil, SÃ£o Paulo in 2019.

I have a CISCO and Azure certification and also working experience in network engineering.
However, since I discover the software engineering area I never wanted to leave that field, that is the type of work that excite me.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
          I have a wide range of hobbies and passions that keep me busy. From reading, playing sports, traveling and learning new skills and knowledge.
I&#39;m always looking for new experiences that can improve my soft and hard skills.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I believe that you should{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-teal-500">
              never stop growing
            </span>{" "}
            and that&#39;s what I strive to do.
I have a passion for technology and a desire to always push the limits of what is possible. I&#39;m excited to see where my career takes me and I&#39;m always open to new opportunities. ðŸ™‚
